# Tic Tac Toe instructions
## Rules
- When the user selects a cell that is not empty

- Then the game says "That cell is already full. "

- And the board state is unchanged (it does not put an X or O in the cell)

- And the current player does not change

## Stalemate
- Given all cells are full and neither player has three in a row

- When the turn ends

- Then the app says "Stalemate!"

- And the game ends

## Names
- When starting a game, choose the names of the players (not just X and O).

- When displaying the name of a player, use their name and also say which symbol they are (X or O), e.g. Chijioke's turn (X)

## Artificial Intelligence (possible update)
- Instead of picking a random cell, the AI chooses the best random cell
- This will require R&D, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2TcQ3h0ipQ for inspiration
